  			<h1> Magic </h1>
  			<p> Magic or sorcery is the use of rituals, symbols, actions, gestures, and language with the aim of exploiting supernatural forces. The belief in and practice of magic has been present since the earliest human cultures and continues to have an important spiritual, religious, and medicinal role in many cultures today. The belief that one can influence supernatural powers, by prayer, sacrifice, or invocation dates back to prehistoric religions and it can be found in early records such as the Egyptian pyramid texts and the Indian Vedas. Magic and religion are categories of beliefs and systems of knowledge used within societies. Some forms of shamanic contact with the spirit world seem to be nearly universal in the early development of human communities. They appear in various tribal peoples from Aboriginal Australia and MƒÅori people of New Zealand to the Amazon, African savannah, and pagan Europe.

 		 <h1> Science</h1>
 		 <p> Newton's First Law. Newton's First Law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. It may be seen as a statement about inertia, that objects will remain in their state of motion unless a force acts to change the motion. </p>
 		 <p>The Combined Gas Law or General Gas Equation is obtained by combining Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, and Gay-Lussac's Law. It shows the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed mass (quantity) of gas: p V = k 5 T {\displaystyle pV=k_{5}T\,} </p>
 		 <p>In chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology, a dissociation constant Kd is a specific type of equilibrium constant that measures the propensity of a larger object to separate (dissociate) reversibly into smaller components, as when a complex falls apart into its component molecules. </p>

  			<p> We may never meet our true self, never see our true self, save <a href="http://wakinglifemovie.net/Transcript/Chapter/16">through the eyes of someone else </a>.  And that someone else may just as well not be living among us since day one.  He may just as well have appeared out of nowhere, and is very likely to disappear just like that.  But it is our purpose, our one and only purpose to find our true selves- lost in this wilderness of pretence- and thus discover what it is we seek in life, and what it is we can offer.  </p>
